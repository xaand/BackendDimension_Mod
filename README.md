Backend – The Dimension Behind

Backend is a mod that adds a new and mysterious dimension to the game: the Backend — the “backside” of the game’s reality. A place where the world ceases to be organic and reveals its true structure: machines, broken code, and creatures rebuilt in metal.

In this dimension, you will find mechanical versions of familiar monsters, now corrupted and reprogrammed. Robots patrol the environment, systems watch your every move, and challenges test not only your strength, but your persistence.

Your goal is to infiltrate the Backend and extract exclusive resources, materials that cannot be found anywhere else in the game. With them, it is possible to craft a legendary weapon — a weapon reserved only for those who defeat every creature in the world.

A weapon capable of hacking reality itself.

Prepare to face enemies such as the all-seeing Watchers, the relentless system defenders known as Firewalls, and the Machines, entities created solely to eliminate intruders.

The Backend was not made for players.
It was made to be hidden.
Do you dare to enter?


To access the dimension, you must craft a key at the Alchemy Table after reaching 100 Memories (or use /memories unlockall if you have OP). Once crafted, the key allows you to enter the dimension through the Ancient Gate.
